The presence of a significant population of Golden Plover is of note and this species is listed on Annex I of the E.U. Birds Directive. The estuary is a regular staging post for autumn migrants, especially Green Sandpiper, Ruff, Little Stint, Curlew Sandpiper and Spotted Redshank. Little Tern has bred at the outer sand spit, but much of the nesting area has now been washed away as a result of erosion. The maximum number of pairs recorded was 17 in 1991.

It is also the smallest of the five tern species that breed in Ireland. Having spent the winter off the west coast of Africa, the Little Terns take to shingle beaches on the east and west coast of Ireland, creating shallow scrapes in the pebble and sand for their nests (Doyle et al., 2015). \n\n ",p2:"Little Terns are easily distinguished from other by their black caps, yellow feet and yellow, black-tipped beak (Marples and Marples, 1934). Parent Little Terns rely on small fish and crustaceans to feed their young until they are a few days old, as such, proximity to brackish water is of significant importance for breeding Little Terns (Doyle et al., 2015). Little Tern eggs and chicks are excellently adapted to remain hidden in the open on shingle beaches. While this offers protection, the exposed nature of their nest coupled with this camouflage leaves them vulnerable to predation, trampling and, not least, human disturbance (ibid). The use of wardening schemes, fencing and signage has proved successful in a number of Little Tern conservation projects to address his major and long-standing cause of low breeding success among Little terns (Keogh et al, 2013).\n Little Terns are listed on Annex 1 of the European Union Birds Directive (Council Directive 2009/147/EC) and they are fully protected in Ireland under the Wildlife Acts 1976 \u2013 2012. Little Terns are also classified as both rare and localised breeders in Ireland and have been considered a vulnerable species since the early 1990\u2019s. In spite of these protections, however, the species is still experiencing a decline in localised breeding populations, with BirdWatch Ireland amber listing the Little Tern \u201cof medium conservation concern\u201d as a result. The breeding colony of Little Terns at Portrane is a historic colony that has long felt the pressures of human disturbance. The result of this disturbance was the significant reduction in their numbers at Portrane since the 1990s.",p3:"In 2018 the Fingal Branch in conjunction with Fingal County Council, the NPWS and many volunteers fenced off a section of beach and setup a wardening roster to try to protect these vulnerable birds. Thanks to everyone\u2019s hard work we managed to get 14 terns fledged, a huge success considering no more than 2 or 3 fledged in any of the previous 30 years and less than 7 in total. We managed to ring 13 of the chicks (IZ0-IZ9, IX0-IX2).",p4:"2019 looked like it was going to be an even better year with 18 nests with eggs but unfortunately over the course of two nights a predator managed to clear out 17 of the nests. The one remaining pair raised 3 chicks, two of which were ringed (IX4 & IX5). \n In 2020 9 fledged and 8 were ringed (IV0-IV5, IV7-IV9). Sadly, IV9 was found dead on the beach in early August before it fledged and although IV3 & IV4 were seen many times after fledging their sibling IV2 was not and was presumed dead.",p5:"Please report any sightings of the mentioned ringed birds to bwifingal@gmail.com. \n\n Note: All photographs taken under licence and are copyrighted.

In 1998 thanks to the co-operation of Fingal County Council a hide was erected on the south shore of the estuary on council land. It is a large cargo container fitted with a timber interior and raised 2 meters off the ground. Its been a phenomenal success with hundreds of birders from near and far visiting annually.

The outer estuary is quite accessible by public road at Raheen Point, Donabate and The Burrow, Portrane on the southern side and at Rogerstown and Baleally Lane on the northern side. The inner estuary can be accessed from two points. If approached from Balleally Road, cross the style at parking place (limited to 1 or 2 cars) and take the right-of-way down to the reserve.

The presence of a significant population of Golden Plover is of note and this species is listed on Annex I of the E.U. Birds Directive. The estuary is a regular staging post for autumn migrants, especially Green Sandpiper, Ruff, Little Stint, Curlew Sandpiper and Spotted Redshank. Little Tern has bred at the outer sand spit, but much of the nesting area has now been washed away as a result of erosion. The maximum number of pairs recorded was 17 in 1991. Ringed Plover breed in the same area. The outer part of the estuary has been designated a Statutory Nature Reserve and a Special Protection Area under the E.U. Birds Directive. The inner estuary has been damaged by the refuse tip which covers 40 ha of mudflat. This site is a good example of an estuarine system, with all typical habitats represented, including several listed on Annex I of the E.U. Habitats Directive.
